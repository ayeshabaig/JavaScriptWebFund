            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p> 
                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it       in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment(a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to provide programatic control over them.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values -imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="purple">var x;</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="">Variable Assignment</a> Assignmemts operators assign values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holders the coffee, a variable holds a value. All Javascript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="purple">var x=10</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="">Data Types</a> Data Types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives. Boolean - <span class="purple">true</span> or <span class="purple">false</span>; null aka nothing; Number - <span class="purple">42</span> or <span class="purple">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="purple">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="purple">{first_name:'Jane', last_name:'Doe'}</span>
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <a href="">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions-hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions-hitting different code based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="purple">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="purple">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="purple">else</span> we execute this block of code
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <a href="Loops"></a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That is a loop!
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <a href="Function"></a> Functions are the encapulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of ot as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instrutions manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over again
